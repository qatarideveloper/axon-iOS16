# Axon iOS 16

Axon is a Theos tweak that brings Priority Hub-style grouped notifications to jailbroken iOS 16 devices. It reorganizes Lock Screen and Notification Center notifications by application, adds icon-based filtering, and exposes preference controls for layout, style, badges, haptics, sorting, and display behavior.

This fork targets a roothide-style package build and keeps the tweak logic and preference bundle together in one Theos project.

## Features

- Groups notifications by app on the Lock Screen and Notification Center.
- Supports horizontal and vertical layouts.
- App icons can show badge counts and optional backgrounds.
- Preference bundle for enabling the tweak, changing styles, alignment, icon behavior, sorting, spacing, haptics, and default visibility.
- Compatibility hooks for common lock-screen notification flows, including clearing and notification-history behavior.
- Builds a tweak bundle plus an `AxonPrefs` preference bundle.

## Requirements

- Jailbroken iOS 16 device using a compatible roothide environment.
- Theos installed and configured.
- MobileSubstrate-compatible injection environment.
- Xcode command-line tools or an equivalent iOS toolchain.

The package metadata is in `control` and declares:

- Package id: `me.nepeta.axon`
- Package name: `Axon`
- Firmware dependency: `>= 16.0`
- Architecture: `iphoneos-arm`

## Repository Layout

```text
.
|-- control              # Debian package metadata
|-- Makefile             # Top-level Theos aggregate
|-- Tweak/               # SpringBoard notification hooks and Axon UI
|-- Prefs/               # Preference bundle shown in Settings
`-- LICENSE
```

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
make clean package
```

The top-level `Makefile` sets:

```make
THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME = roothide
FINALPACKAGE = 1
DEBUG = 0
```

The generated `.deb` package will be written under `packages/`.

## Install

Copy the built `.deb` to the device and install it with your package manager or with `dpkg` over SSH:

```bash
dpkg -i packages/*.deb
uicache -a
sbreload
```

If the preference bundle does not appear immediately, respring and reopen Settings.

## Preferences

Runtime preferences are stored at:

```text
/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/me.nepeta.axon.plist
```

Important preference keys include:

- `Enabled`
- `Vertical`
- `HapticFeedback`
- `BadgesEnabled`
- `BadgesShowBackground`
- `DarkMode`
- `SortingMode`
- `SelectionStyle`
- `Style`
- `ShowByDefault`
- `Alignment`
- `iconStyle`
- `VerticalPosition`
- `Spacing`

The preference bundle writes these values, and the tweak reads them during SpringBoard initialization.

## Development Notes

- `Tweak/Tweak.xm` contains the SpringBoard and Notification Center hooks.
- `Tweak/AXNManager.*` owns notification request state and filtering.
- `Tweak/AXNView.*` and `Tweak/AXNAppCell.*` render the grouped app selector.
- `Prefs/Resources/Prefs.plist` defines the settings UI.
- This project hooks private iOS classes, so iOS updates may require selector or class-name maintenance.
